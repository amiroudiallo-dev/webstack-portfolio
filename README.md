### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:
#### Tech Stack:

DevOps tools (Jenkins, Docker, GitHub)

#### Description:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline for a sample application. 
Automate the build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub.

### Week 1

- [x] Install and configure Jenkins, Docker, and Git on your environment.
- [x] Choose or develop a sample application (e.g. a simple web service in Python).
- [x] Create a GitHub repository for the application.

### Week 2

- [ ] Configure Jenkins to monitor the GitHub repository.
- [ ] Set up a simple build pipeline that compiles the application and runs automated tests.
- [ ] Create a Docker image for the application and test it locally.

### Week 3

- [ ] Extend the Jenkins pipeline to include containerization with Docker.
- [ ] Configure a testing/staging environment and automate deployment.

### Week 4
- [ ] Finalize the pipeline for production deployment (if applicable).
- [ ] Test the entire CI/CD process to ensure it works smoothly.
- [ ] Prepare project documentation and presentation.
